## What It Does

Select a trick and watch an animated breakdown of the physics involved — force vectors, rotation angles, energy conversions, and more. Adjust skater mass and animation speed to see how physics changes.

### Tricks Covered
- **Ollie** — Lever mechanics, Newton's 3rd law
- **Kickflip** — Angular momentum, gyroscopic stability
- **Pop Shove-it** — Yaw rotation, torque couples
- **Manual** — Inverted pendulum, balance physics
- **Drop In** — Energy conservation (PE → KE), centripetal force
- **50-50 Grind** — Kinetic friction, energy dissipation

### Features
- Animated stick figure + board with real-time force arrows
- Phase timeline showing each stage of the trick
- Adjustable skater mass (affects force calculations)
- Speed control for slow-mo analysis
- Detailed physics explanations and stats per trick

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Canvas 2D rendering
- No dependencies, no build step
- Static hosting on GitHub Pages

## Development
Just open `index.html` in a browser. No build required.
